# 💯 Baddie Rating System

A modern, web-based React app that allows users to rate physical appearance based on a 10-factor methodology. 

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

It is **not intended** to objectify, degrade, or disrespect real individuals.  
All ratings must be given with consent and awareness of the non-serious nature of this system.  

Use responsibly. Don’t be weird.

## 🧠 Core Concept

This system is not a porn rating tool — it's a framework for identifying real 10/10s based on disciplined scoring. Using 10 factors, each scored 0–1, the system defines tiers from "Regular" to "God Tier".

### 🔟 Factors:
- Facial Structure
- Hairstyle
- Body Shape
- Breast
- Ass
- Hairs
- Personality
- Physique
- Skin
- Capabilities

> ⚠️ Requires at least 80% body visibility for accurate scoring. No rating if heavily makeup-altered.

## 🧮 Scoring System

- **Total score:** Max 10 (with optional Personal Bias added only at full 10).
- **Final Category:** Auto-calculated and labeled (Regular, Top Ones, Only Fiction, Absolute Cinema, etc).

## 📦 Features

- Real-time scoring with sliders
- Category auto-detection
- Personal Bias slider (unlocks only at 10/10)
- Clear instructions & methodology display
